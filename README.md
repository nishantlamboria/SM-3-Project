This project investigates gender parity in Olympic precision sports, specifically focusing on archery and shooting. Unlike many physically demanding sports, archery and shooting are skill-driven events where factors such as focus, precision, and control play a larger role than physical strength. Using Olympic finals data, I compare the performance of male and female athletes to assess differences in outcomes. Statistical analyses, including mean comparison tests and tests for proportions, are applied to identify any significant performance gaps between genders. Results suggest that in precision sports like archery and shooting, male and female athletes perform at comparable levels, suggesting that skill-intensive sports show minimal gender disparities. This study contributes to a broader understanding of gender parity in sports and highlights events where skill can overshadow physical differences, promoting greater inclusivity in competitive sports.
